<h2>General Discussion of the Algorithm</h2>
<h4>
    The aim of the algorithm described in the paper is to solve the measure and contour problem for a set of Iso-Rectangles using Divide and Conquer technique.<br>
    Usually the sweep line technique was used for this but Guting aimed to achieve O(NlogN) time complexity using divide and conquer. The idea is to use seperational<br>
    representations.We divide the 2-D plane into a set of horizontal stripes and in each divide step, we break this plane into half.For the conquer step, we merge<br> 
    the 2 sets of stripes by using different functions such as copy, blacken and conact. Finally after the construction of these stripes, from the union of intersecting <br>
    intervals, we find the contour lines and the measure of the rectangles.

<h2>Issues in Coding</h2>
<h4>The research paper was a little difficult to interpret sometimes as it was written in 1984 and somethings were kept very obtuse. Another issue faced was handling segmentation faults<br>
and memory allocations. Also implementing the different custom data types was also difficult and required keen attention. Another issue faced was handling the case of same x and y coordinates<br>
for 2 rectangles as this is handled at the end of the paper and only in a text manner without much pseudo code</h4>
